   - Revenue reporting
   - Sales targets and forecasting

4. **Reward Points System**

## Data Flow

### Inventory Flow

   - Allocates inventory to clients
   - Sets pricing tiers

2. **Client**
   - Receives inventory from admin company
   - Manages client-level inventory
   - Allocates products to dealers
   - Sets dealer pricing

3. **Dealer**

   - Tracks dealer-level inventory
   - Sells to end customers
   - Reports sales back to client

### Sales Flow

1. **Dealer Sales**
   - Dealer records sales to customers
   - System calculates dealer points earned
   - Sales data flows up to client
   - Inventory automatically adjusted

2. **Client Sales Tracking**
   - Aggregates dealer sales data
   - Calculates client revenue and points
   - Verifies dealer sales claims
   - Reports to admin company

3. **Admin Company Oversight**

   - Analyzes performance metrics
   - Manages global reward programs
   - Sets system-wide sales targets

### Reward Points Flow

1. **Points Earning**
