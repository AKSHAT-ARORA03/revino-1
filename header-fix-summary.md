# Header Duplication Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was displaying duplicate headers in various pages because:

1. The router's `ProtectedLayout` component included a `Header` component
2. Many individual page components were using a `Layout` component that also included its own `Header`

This was causing two headers to be stacked on top of each other.

## Solution
We implemented the following changes to fix this issue:

1. Removed the `Layout` wrapper component from all page components, leaving the content to be rendered directly within the `ProtectedLayout`'s content area:
   - SettingsPage.tsx
   - AnalyticsPage.tsx
   - ClientsPage.tsx
   - ContestsPage.tsx
   - CreateContestPage.tsx
   - DealersPage.tsx
   - InventoryAllocationPage.tsx
   - InventoryManagementPage.tsx
   - OrdersPage.tsx
   - ProductCatalogPage.tsx
   - ProfilePage.tsx
   - RewardsPage.tsx
   - SalesPage.tsx
   - AdminManagementPage.tsx

2. Created and executed a script (`scripts/fix-duplicated-headers.js`) to:
   - Remove `import Layout from '../components/layout/Layout'`
   - Replace `<Layout> ... </Layout>` wrappers with just the inner content

## Architecture Explanation
The application now follows a cleaner pattern where:

1. The router (`router.tsx`) sets up routes with the `ProtectedLayout` component for authenticated sections
2. The `ProtectedLayout` provides a consistent layout including `Sidebar` and `Header` components
3. Individual page components render their content directly within the `ProtectedLayout`'s content area

This prevents duplication of UI elements and ensures a consistent user experience.

## Recommendation for Future Development
When adding new pages, developers should:

1. Do NOT wrap page content in the `Layout` component when the page is rendered within `ProtectedLayout`
2. Use the `ProtectedLayout` for all authenticated pages that need the standard header and sidebar
3. Only use the `Layout` component for standalone pages that aren't wrapped in `ProtectedLayout`
