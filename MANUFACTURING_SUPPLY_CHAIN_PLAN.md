# Manufacturing Supply Chain Management System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for transforming the current dealer loyalty platform into a comprehensive manufacturing supply chain management system. The system will support the hierarchical relationship between the manufacturer (admin), clients (bulk buyers), and dealers (retailers).

## Current System Analysis

The existing platform has:
- User role structure (super_admin, client, dealer)
- Basic authentication and user management
- Sales tracking and performance metrics
- Contest and reward mechanisms
- Dashboard views customized by role

## Enhanced System Architecture

### User Role Hierarchy

1. **Manufacturer (Admin)**
   - Produces and manages products
   - Sells products in bulk to clients
   - Manages the entire supply chain
   - Has visibility across all clients and dealers

2. **Clients (Bulk Buyers)**
   - Purchase products in bulk from the manufacturer
   - Resell products to dealers
   - Manage their network of dealers
   - Have visibility of their dealers only

3. **Dealers (Retailers)**
   - Purchase products from clients
   - Sell products to end consumers
   - Track their own sales and performance
   - Participate in incentive programs

       manufacturerPrice: Number,
       suggestedClientPrice: Number,
       suggestedRetailPrice: Number
     },
     inventory: {
       currentStock: Number,
       reorderLevel: Number,
       reservedStock: Number
     },
     images: [String],
     status: String // active, discontinued, etc.
   }
   ```

2. **Inventory Model**
   ```javascript
   {
     productId: ObjectId,
     location: String,
     quantity: Number,
     batchNumber: String,
     movementType: String, // in, out, adjustment
     referenceOrder: ObjectId,
     date: Date,
     notes: String
   }
   ```

3. **Order Model**
   ```javascript
   {
     orderNumber: String,
     buyerId: ObjectId, // client or dealer
     sellerId: ObjectId, // manufacturer or client
     orderDate: Date,
     items: [{
       productId: ObjectId,
       quantity: Number,
       unitPrice: Number,
       totalPrice: Number
     }],
     status: String, // pending, approved, shipped, delivered, etc.
     shippingDetails: Object,
